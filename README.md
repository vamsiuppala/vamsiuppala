### Hi, I'm Vamsi ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist at ServiceNow, working on building machine learning models to predict some key revenue subscription KPIs. 

I write at [A Pinch of Data](https://vamsiuppala.github.io/about.html).

I document everything I learn and reuse [here](https://gist.github.com/vamsiuppala).

I used to work at DoorDash, Allbirds, Dun & Bradstreet and Axtria. My interests in Data Science include building simple models, product analytics, data science metric tracking tooling, MLOps and production, simulations and explainable AI.

I have ~9 years of experience as a Full Stack Data Scientist, in Experimentation (A/B Testing, Causal Inference), Machine Learning (user retention, forecasts) and have some MLOps knowledge (Azure AI).

I write extensively in Python and SQL and rely on Azure for MLOps.

I have a Masters in Industrial Engineering (Operations Research) from Purdue University and a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani.

I'm best reached via email at uvvamsikrishna@gmail.com or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamsiuppala/). I'm always open to chatting about all things data.
